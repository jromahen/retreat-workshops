    * XeLaTeX (_TeXLive full distribution recommended_)
    * TeX Package: fontspec
    * TeX Package: hyperref
    * TeX Package: longtable
    * TeX Package: graphicx
    * TeX Package: multicol
    * TeX Package: ulem
    * TeX Package: tipa

From the `src/` directory, simply execute the command:

And a few seconds later, a PDF should be hot off the presses.
